# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user.
### Step 2: 
prepare the program for distance between two points
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the values using distance formula
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

    import math
    x1,y1 = 4,2
    x2,y2 = 10,6
    d = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
    print(round(d,2))


### OUTPUT:
